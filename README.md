<p><h2><strong>Dog Breed Classifier:</strong></h2><em><h3> Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.</h3></em></p>

<p>In this project, I have learnt how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.<br>

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, I haev made important design decisions about the user experience for my app. I understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.!</p>
